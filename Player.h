/*
 i am not sure  whether or not to add a variable for level here or add it in the events class
 that part did not seem completely clear from the instructions
 Also to be honest i havent fully understood polymorphism ... like in the practical sense so i am no sure how to  have this class inherit  from Actors.h
Due to the above I have left the Level up function to you to implement . Also I need to read upp on inventories before adding the list of Items here
